# Python_examples
Hello, 

I am proud to introduce some of my codes. Most of them are not quite difficult, but making them i was focusing on doing them clear and well understandable. I am planning to do some more serious projects but now i want to learn good habits while programing.

Here is quick guide to all programs in this repository:

1. pi_calculation_using_Vpython.py

Mentioned first, because it is the most interesting one. This program is using phisics to calculate number pi (using momentum conservation law). While calculating program also show visualisation on how objects are moving. At the begining only one object is moving, but while contact with another it gives half of its kinetic energy to touched object, and then 2 objects are moving. Only wall on the right is standing static. Numbers of contacts with: object-object and wall-object is stored in memory and then used to calculate some approximation of pi number. For better understandable I recomend to run program using link mentioned below:

2. Reverse_Polish_Notation.py

This program contains method that can tcalculate ONP phrase (containing numbers and math operators like: "+", "-", "*", "/"). Sadly, now it only works with specific numbers: 0-10, 12, 123, 23, 1234, 234, 34, 12345, 2345, 345, 45, etc. I will fix it soon.

3. Fifo_method.py

Program that shows way to do class similar to C ++ available when program include std :: queue from <queue> library.
  
4. bisection.py
  
Program that use bisection to find number in sorted list containing numbers.

5. bubble_sort_method.py
  
Program that sort list containing numbers using bubble method.
